============


Contributing Code
=================

* A good patch:

    * is clear
    * works across all supported versions of Python
    * follows the existing style of the code base (PEP-8)
    * has docstrings (we use Goole style docstrings)
    * has comments included as needed

* A test case that demonstrates the previous flaw that now passes
  with the included patch
* If it adds/changes a public API, it must also include documentation
  for those changes


Reporting An Issue/Feature
==========================

* Check to see if there's an existing issue/pull request for the
  bug/feature. All issues are at https://github.com/qba73/circleclient/issues
  and pull reqs are at https://github.com/qba73/circleclient/pulls
* If there isn't an existing issue there, please file an issue. The ideal
  report includes:

  * A description of the problem/suggestion
  * Steps to recreate the bug/issue
  * Versions of your Python interpreter
